### Air Quality Alert
- **Area**: Coachella Valley
- **Severity**: Unknown
- **Description**: The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to harmful levels of particle pollution from windblown dust. Levels of particle pollution can vary by time and location depending on emissions and local weather conditions. Particle pollution can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems such as asthma attacks, heart and lung disease symptoms, and increased risk of lung infections. Everyone can be affected, but sensitive groups such as people with lung or heart disease, older adults, people who are pregnant, children, and those who spend a lot of time outdoors are at greater risk.
- **When**: until late Saturday night.
- **Instructions**: To protect your health, check air quality levels and act as needed. To help keep indoor air clean when air quality is poor: Keep windows and doors closed, run your air conditioner and/or an air purifier, do not use whole house fans or swamp coolers that bring in outside air if you have other methods to stay cool, avoid other sources of pollution such as fireplaces, candles, incense, grilling, and gasoline-powered lawn and garden equipment. To help minimize outdoor particle pollution levels: Carpool, telecommute, reduce trips, or take public transportation, slow down if driving on dirt roads, stabilize loose soils. To view current and forecasted air quality levels, visit the South Coast Air Quality Management District website at aqmd.gov or download the mobile app at www.aqmd.gov/mobileapp. Additional details for this air quality alert may be available at www.aqmd.gov/advisory.
